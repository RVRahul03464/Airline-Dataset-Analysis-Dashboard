Airline Dataset Analysis Dashboard - End-to-End Project

Objective:
The purpose of this project is to analyze airline passenger and flight data to uncover insights into travel trends, passenger demographics, and airport activity. The dashboard provides a data-driven approach for improving airline operations and strategic decision-making.

Data Source:
The dataset consists of airline records, including passenger details, flight schedules, airport information, and pilot assignments.

Tools Used:
•	Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing
•	SQL – Data extraction and transformation
•	Power BI/Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard development

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Tracked:

•	Passenger Demographics & Distribution:
o	Passengers by Age Group: Distribution of passengers across age ranges
o	Count of Passengers by Gender: Gender-based segmentation
o	Count of Passengers by Nationality: Nationality-wise distribution
o	Average Age of Passengers: Mean passenger age

•	Flight Operations & Airport Analytics:
o	Flights by Departure Airport: Categorization based on departure locations
o	Flights by Arrival Airport: Categorization based on arrival destinations
o	Flights by Airport Continent: Breakdown of flight routes across continents
o	Flights by Passenger Continent: Travel trends by passenger’s continent of origin
o	Flights by Month: Monthly trends in flight operations
o	Flights by Quarter: Quarterly trend analysis
o	Flights by Day: Daily flight activity patterns

•	Flight Performance & Pilot Analysis:
o	Flights by Flight Status: Categorization of on-time, delayed, and canceled flights
o	On-Time Flights by Pilot Name: Performance evaluation of pilots based on punctuality
o	Flights by Pilot Name: Total number of flights assigned to each pilot

•	Geographical & Statistical Insights:
o	Total Number of Countries Covered
o	Total Number of Pilots in the Dataset
o	Count of Unique Airports and Arrival Airports
o	Count of Continents Covered
o	Count of Unique Nationalities
o	Passenger Distribution by Country (Map Visualization)

Filters & Slicers:

•	Quarter, Month, and Day filters for interactive data exploration and trend analysis

Visualization:
An interactive dashboard in Power BI or Tableau, offering real-time insights into flight trends, passenger demographics, and airport activity for improved decision-making.

Outcome:
This project helps identify key travel trends, passenger demographics, and airport traffic patterns. The insights can aid airlines in optimizing flight schedules, improving on-time performance, and enhancing customer service strategies.
